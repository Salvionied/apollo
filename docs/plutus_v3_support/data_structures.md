# Plutus V3 Data Structures

This document details the integration of Plutus V3 scripts within the `TransactionWitnessSet` structure in the Apollo library, as defined in [`serialization/TransactionWitnessSet/TransactionWitnessSet.go`](serialization/TransactionWitnessSet/TransactionWitnessSet.go).

## `PlutusV3Script` Field in `TransactionWitnessSet`

The `TransactionWitnessSet` struct is a critical component of a Cardano transaction, containing all the necessary witnesses for validating the transaction. For Plutus V3, the `TransactionWitnessSet` includes a dedicated field to hold Plutus V3 scripts.

```go
type TransactionWitnessSet struct {
 VKeyWitnesses      []*Vkeywitness                                `cbor:"0,keyasint,omitempty"`
 NativeScripts      []NativeScript.NativeScript                   `cbor:"1,keyasint,omitempty"`
 BootstrapWitnesses []*BootstrapWitness                           `cbor:"2,keyasint,omitempty"`
 PlutusV1Script     []PlutusData.PlutusV1Script                   `cbor:"3,keyasint,omitempty"`
 PlutusData         *PlutusData.PlutusIndefArray                  `cbor:"4,keyasint,omitempty"`
 Redeemers          []Redeemer.Redeemer                           `cbor:"5,keyasint,omitempty"`
 PlutusV2Script     []PlutusData.PlutusV2Script                   `cbor:"6,keyasint,omitempty"`
 PlutusV3Script     []PlutusData.PlutusV3Script                   `cbor:"7,keyasint,omitempty"` // Plutus V3 Scripts
}
```

- `PlutusV3Script []PlutusData.PlutusV3Script`: This field is a slice of `PlutusV3Script` types. While it can hold Plutus V3 scripts, it is more common for this field to be empty, as these scripts are usually not bundled with the transaction they are validating. Instead, transactions often use references to scripts that have been included in the outputs of other transactions.

**Usage Context:**

When building a transaction that interacts with Plutus V3 smart contracts, any Plutus V3 scripts that need to be included in the transaction for validation purposes are added to this `PlutusV3Script` field within the `TransactionWitnessSet`. The `ApolloBuilder` automatically populates this field when `AttachV3Script` is used and the transaction witness set is built.

**Example (Conceptual - internal to ApolloBuilder):**

While direct manipulation of `TransactionWitnessSet` is generally handled by the `ApolloBuilder`, conceptually, the process involves:

1. **Attaching a Plutus V3 Script:**

   ```go
   // In ApolloBuilder.AttachV3Script
   // ...
   b.v3scripts = append(b.v3scripts, script)
   // ...
   ```

2. **Building the Transaction Witness Set:**

   ```go
   // In ApolloBuilder.BuildTxWitnessSet
   // ...
   witnessSet := &TransactionWitnessSet{
       // ... other witnesses
       PlutusV3Script: b.v3scripts, // Populating the PlutusV3Script field
   }
   // ...
   ```

This structured approach, whether by bundling scripts or more commonly by referencing them, ensures that all necessary Plutus V3 scripts are available for successful on-chain validation.
